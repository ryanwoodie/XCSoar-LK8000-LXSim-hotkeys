# XCSoar-LK8000-hotkeys
Create hotkeys using a graphical interface to control XCSoar or LK8000 while Condor is active. Great for VR.

This script will pass the hotkeys to XCSoar/LK8000 without losing focus on your active app (ie. Condor).

Here are some of the things you can do in XCsoar without leaving Condor or VR:
- Go to the F1 Quick Menu, access menus and adjust most settings (eg: add ballast in "Flight Setup")
- Go to Pan Mode, look around the map and zoom in/out to plan out your route
- Go to next or prev waypoint
- Change MC setting

To use this:
1. Copy the custom_keys.xci file to your XCSoar directory. In XCSoar go to config > system > language/input > events and choose this xci file.
2. Run the AutoHotKey script and assign keys/buttons or joystick axes, d-pad or HAT/POV to the various XCsoar or LK8000 commands.

There are extra_1 to extra_4 hotkeys if you want to add more commands into your XCI file (assign these to F21 to F24 keys in your XCI file)
