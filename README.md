# XCSoar-LK8000-hotkeys
Create hotkeys using a graphical interface to control XCSoar or LK8000 while Condor is active. Great for VR.

To use this:
1. Copy the custom_keys.xci file to your XCSoar directory. In XCSoar go to config > system > language/input > events and choose this file.
2. Run the AutoHotKey script and assign keys/buttons or joystick axes, d-pad or HAT/POV to the various XCsoar or LK8000 commands.

There are extra_1 to extra_4 hotkeys if you want to add more commands into your XCI file (assign these to F21 to F24 keys in your XCI file)
